      <P>
        Where a JWT makes the client carry proof of identity, a{' '}
        <strong className="text-primary">session</strong> makes the server remember you. Login
        creates a record in server-side storage; the browser only ever holds a small random ID
        pointing at that record. Every request, the server asks &ldquo;who does this ID belong
        to?&rdquo;
      </P>

      <Callout type="idea" title="The one-sentence version">
        A session cookie is a pointer, not the data — the real &ldquo;who is this user&rdquo; lives
        in server storage, which is exactly what makes it revocable in an instant.
      </Callout>

      <H2 id="whats-a-session">What&rsquo;s actually in the cookie</H2>
      <P>
        Open your browser&rsquo;s dev tools on almost any logged-in site and you&rsquo;ll see
        something like <Code>connect.sid=s%3AaBcD1234...</Code>. That&rsquo;s it — a random string.
        It carries no name, no role, no permissions. All of that lives in a record on the server,
        keyed by this ID:
      </P>
      <UL>
        <LI>
          <strong className="text-primary">The cookie</strong> — just the session ID, marked{' '}
          <Code>HttpOnly</Code> (invisible to JS) and <Code>Secure</Code> (HTTPS only).
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <strong className="text-primary">The session store</strong> — a fast key-value store
          (Redis is the usual choice) or a database table mapping that ID to{' '}
          <Code>{'{ userId, role, createdAt, expiresAt }'}</Code>.
        </LI>
      </UL>

      <H2 id="flow">The full round trip, request by request</H2>
      <P>
        Login, then one authenticated request — notice the extra hop to the session store on
        <em> every</em> request. Click any arrow to jump straight to that moment.
      </P>

      <SequenceDiagram actors={ACTORS} steps={STEPS} autoPlayMs={2500} />

      <H2 id="revocation">The superpower: logging someone out for real</H2>
      <P>
        Because the server actually owns the record, logging out is a single delete:{' '}
        <Code>DELETE session sess_abc123</Code>. The next request with that cookie finds nothing in
        the store and is rejected immediately — even if the cookie itself is still sitting in the
        browser. Compare that to a JWT, which stays valid until it naturally expires, no matter what
        the server wants.
      </P>

      <Callout type="warning" title="Common mistake">
        Storing sessions in a single server&rsquo;s memory (the default in many tutorials) silently
        breaks the moment you run more than one server instance — user A logs in on server 1, their
        next request hits server 2, which has never heard of them. Use a shared store like Redis
        once you have more than one instance.

      <H2 id="vs-jwt">Sessions vs. JWT, side by side</H2>
      <P>
        Neither is &ldquo;better&rdquo; — they trade the same two things in opposite directions: a
        session costs you a lookup on every request but buys instant, total revocation; a JWT skips
        the lookup for pure speed and horizontal scale, but a stolen token stays valid until it
        expires. Plenty of real systems use both — short JWT access tokens for API calls, backed by
        a session-like refresh token the server can revoke.
