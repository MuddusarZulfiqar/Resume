      <P>
        Traditional logins made the server remember you — a session stored in memory or a database,
        looked up on every request. A <strong className="text-primary">JWT (JSON Web Token)</strong>{' '}
        flips that: instead of the server remembering, the client carries a small, signed proof of
        who it is on every single request. The server verifies the proof with math, not a lookup.
      </P>

      <Callout type="idea" title="The one-sentence version">
        A JWT is a tamper-proof claim — &ldquo;I am user 42, and the server agreed to this as of 10
        minutes ago&rdquo; — that the client presents instead of making the server remember it.
      </Callout>

      <H2 id="anatomy">What&rsquo;s actually inside a JWT</H2>
      <P>
        A JWT is just three base64url-encoded chunks joined by dots:{' '}
        <Code>header.payload.signature</Code>. Paste any JWT into jwt.io and you can read the first
        two parts instantly — they are <em>encoded, not encrypted</em>.
      </P>
      <UL>
        <LI>
          <strong className="text-primary">Header</strong> — which algorithm signed this token,
          e.g. <Code>{'{ "alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT" }'}</Code>.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <strong className="text-primary">Payload</strong> — the actual claims:{' '}
          <Code>{'{ "sub": "user_42", "role": "admin", "exp": 1735689600 }'}</Code>. Anyone who
          intercepts the token can read this.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <strong className="text-primary">Signature</strong> —{' '}
          <Code>{'HMACSHA256(header + "." + payload, secretKey)'}</Code>. Change one character of
          the payload and the signature no longer matches — that&rsquo;s how tampering gets caught.
        </LI>
      </UL>

      <Callout type="warning" title="Common mistake">
        The payload is readable by anyone with the token — it is signed, not encrypted. Never put
        passwords, secrets, or anything sensitive in a JWT payload, even if &ldquo;only the server
        reads it.&rdquo; The client (and anyone on the network) can decode it in one line of code.
      </Callout>

      <H2 id="flow">The full round trip, request by request</H2>
      <P>
        Here&rsquo;s the entire lifecycle: one login, then one authenticated request. Click any
        arrow to jump to that moment, or let it play.

      <H2 id="why-stateless">Why &ldquo;no database lookup&rdquo; is the whole point</H2>
      <P>
        After login, the server never queries anything to check who you are — it just re-verifies
        the signature using a secret key only it knows. That means any server behind a load
        balancer can validate the same token without sharing session state, which is exactly why
        JWTs are the default for APIs and microservices that need to scale horizontally.
      </P>

      <Callout type="tip" title="In practice">
        Most production setups pair a short-lived JWT access token with a longer-lived refresh
        token stored in an httpOnly cookie — so a stolen access token expires fast, while the user
        doesn&rsquo;t have to re-login every 15 minutes.
      </Callout>

      <H2 id="vs-sessions">JWT vs. sessions, in one line</H2>
      <P>
        JWTs trade a database lookup for a math check — great for stateless, distributed APIs, but
        it means you can&rsquo;t instantly revoke a single token (it&rsquo;s valid until it expires,
        full stop). Sessions make the opposite trade. That comparison is exactly what the next post
        covers.
